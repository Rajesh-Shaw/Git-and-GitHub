Git Staging
One of the core functions of Git is the concepts of the Staging Environment, and the Commit.

As you are working, you may be adding, editing and removing files. But whenever you hit a milestone or finish a part of the work, you should add the files to a Staging Environment.

Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on. You will learn more about commit shortly.

For now, we are done working with index.html. So we can add it to the Staging Environment:


$ git add 01  git introduction.txt


$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   01  git introduction.txt

Now the file has been added to the Staging Environment.






Git Add More than One File
You can also stage more than one file at a time. Let's add 2 more files to our working folder. Use the text editor again.

A README.md file that describes the repository (recommended for all repositories):

we move two files inside git repo now cheek git status



$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   01  git introduction.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        02  git install.txt
        README.md



here we see two file are untracked
 02  git install.txt
        README.m

now need to add them or staging them inside repo thats why we use 'git add --all'  or  'git add --A'


$ git add --all

Using --all instead of individual filenames will stage all changes (new, modified, and deleted) files.



$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   01  git introduction.txt
        new file:   02  git install.txt
        new file:   README.md


Now all 3 files are added to the Staging Environment, and we are ready to do our first commit.
