what does git do ?
	
	Manage projects with Repositories
	Clone a project to work on a local copy
	Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
	Branch and Merge to allow for work on different 	parts and versions of a project
	Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
	Push local updates to the main project	





Working with Git....

	Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
	Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
	When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
	You select the modified files you want to Stage
	The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
	Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
	You can revert back to any previous commit.
	Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!





Why Git?
	Over 70% of developers use Git!
	Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
	Developers can see the full history of the project.
	Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.


What is GitHub?
	Git is not the same as GitHub.
	GitHub makes tools that use Git.
	GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.
