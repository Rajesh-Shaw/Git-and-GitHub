Edit Code in GitHub
In addition to being a host for Git content, GitHub has a very good code editor.

Let's try to edit the README.md file in GitHub. Just click the edit button:

Add some changes to the code, and then commit the changes. For now, we will "Commit directly to the master branch".
And add a description for the commit.
