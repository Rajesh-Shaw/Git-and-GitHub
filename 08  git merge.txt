Topic :
Git Branch merge



merge branchs
First, we need to change to the master branch:

git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'

we marge the installation steps with master

$ git marge installation
git: 'marge' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

The most similar command is
        merge



Now we have a better understanding of how branches and merging works. Time to start working with a remote repository!
