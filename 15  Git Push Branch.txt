Git Push Branch


Push a Branch to GitHub
Let's try to create a new local branch, and push that to GitHub.
Start by creating a branch, like we did earlier:

$ git checkout -b update-readme
Switched to a new branch 'update-readme'



And we make some changes to the README.md file. Just add a new line.
So now we check the status of the current branch.

$ git status
On branch update-readme
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   01  git introduction.txt
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")



We see that README.md is modified but not added to the Staging Environment:

$ git add README.md



Check the status of the branch:
$ git status
On branch update-readme
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.md






We are happy with our changes. So we will commit them to the branch:

$ git commit -m "Updated readme for GitHub Branches"
[update-readme 6665a16] Updated readme for GitHub Branches
 1 file changed, 6 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)





Now push the branch from our local Git repository, to GitHub, where everyone can see the changes:


$ git push origin update-readme

 * [new branch]      update-readme -> update-readme





Go to GitHub, and confirm that the repository has a new branch:



In GitHub, we can now see the changes and merge them into the master branch if we approve it.

If you click the "Compare & pull request", you can go through the changes made and new files added:





Note: This comparison shows both the changes from update-readme and git-exercise because we created the new branch FROMgit-exercise .



If the changes look good, you can go forward, creating a pull request:



A pull request is how you propose changes. You can ask some to review your changes or pull your contribution and merge it into their branch.

Since this is your own repository, you can  merge your pull request yourself:



To keep the repo from getting overly complicated, you can delete the now unused branch by clicking "Delete branch".
