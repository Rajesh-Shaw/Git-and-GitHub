Git Commit

Since we have finished our work, we are ready move from stage to commit for our repo.

Adding commits keep track of our progress and changes as we work. Git considers each commit change point or "save point". It is a point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change.

When we commit, we should always include a message.


$ git commit -m "added git introduction, installation, readme.md"
[master (root-commit) 95a20d1] added git introduction, installation, readme.md
 3 files changed, 138 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 01  git introduction.txt
 create mode 100644 02  git install.txt
 create mode 100644 README.md




The commit command performs a commit, and the -m "message" adds a message.
The Staging Environment has been committed to our repo, with the message:
"added git introduction, installation, readme.md"



Git Commit without Stage
Sometimes, when you make small changes, using the staging environment seems like a waste of time. It is possible to commit changes directly, skipping the staging environment. The -a option will automatically stage every changed, already tracked file.

Let's add a small update to '02  git install.txt':

 git status --short
 M "02  git install.txt"


Note: Short status flags are:
?? - Untracked files
A - Files added to stage
M - Modified files
D - Deleted files



We see the file we expected is modified. So let's commit it directly:

$ git commit -a -m "Updated 02  git install.txt with a new line"
[master d82e89b] Updated 02  git install.txt with a new line
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)






Warning: Skipping the Staging Environment is not generally recommended.
Skipping the stage step can sometimes make you include unwanted changes.
