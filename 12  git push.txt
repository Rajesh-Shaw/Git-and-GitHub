Push Changes to GitHub
Let's add one more file to our local git and pushing them to GitHub.

$ git add --all

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 3 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   05  git commit.txt



Commit the changes:
$ git commit -m "added git commit file"
[master 4954b48] added git commit file
 1 file changed, 85 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 05  git commit.txt




And check the status:
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 4 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean





Now push our changes to our remote origin:

$ git push origin

   3a3570a..4954b48  master -> master





Go to GitHub, and confirm that the repository has a new commit.
Now, we are going to start working on branches on GitHub.
